# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning Algorithms on UK ACCIDENTS 2017-2021

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and implementing Machine Learning algorithms on the UK ACCIDENTS dataset spanning from 2017 to 2021. The dataset provides valuable insights into accident trends, contributing factors, and patterns that can aid in developing predictive models for accident occurrences.

## Files

1. **EDA_UK_Accidents.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the UK ACCIDENTS dataset. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis to uncover meaningful patterns and trends within the data. This EDA helps in gaining a comprehensive understanding of accident-related features.

2. **ML_ALGORITHMS.ipynb**: This notebook delves into implementing Machine Learning algorithms on the UK ACCIDENTS dataset. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. The notebook demonstrates how to build predictive models for accident occurrences based on historical data.

3. **tables.ipynb**: This notebook contains additional analysis that involves creating summary tables, aggregating statistics, and generating insights that might not be covered in the other notebooks. It can include tables that provide a quick overview of accident statistics, correlations, or any other relevant information.

## Dataset

The UK ACCIDENTS dataset used in these notebooks contains records of accidents that occurred between 2017 and 2021 in the United Kingdom. The dataset includes various attributes such as accident severity, location, weather conditions, road type, and more. This dataset serves as the foundation for both the exploratory analysis and machine learning tasks.

The dataset can be obtained from [source link] and should be placed in the `data` directory within the repository.

## Dependencies

To run the notebooks successfully, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
